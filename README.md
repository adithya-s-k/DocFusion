# DocFusion

![DodFusion Banner](./assets/docfusion_banner.png)

**DocFusion** is a Python library for deep document visual understanding. It provides a unified interface for a suite of tasks like layout detection, OCR, table extraction, reading order detection, and more. By abstracting the complexities of setting up pipelines across different libraries and models, **DocFusion** makes it easier than ever to integrate and optimize document analysis workflows.

## üöÄ Why DocFusion?

Working with multiple document analysis tools can be challenging due to differences in APIs, outputs, and data formats. **DocFusion** addresses these pain points by:

- **Unifying APIs:** A consistent interface for all tasks, irrespective of the underlying library or model.
- **Pipeline Optimization:** Pre-built, customizable pipelines for end-to-end document processing.
- **Interoperability:** Smooth integration of outputs from different models into cohesive workflows.
- **Ease of Use:** Focus on high-level functionality without worrying about the underlying complexities.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Layout Detection:** Identify the structure of documents with popular models and tools.
- **OCR:** Extract text from images or scanned PDFs with support for multiple OCR engines.
- **Table Extraction:** Parse and extract data from tables in documents.
- **Reading Order Detection:** Determine the logical reading sequence of elements.
- **Custom Pipelines:** Easily configure and extend pipelines to meet specific use cases.
- **Scalability:** Built to handle large-scale document processing tasks.

Here‚Äôs the updated and more detailed installation section:

## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- `pip` package manager
- **Optional (for GPU support)**: A compatible NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 12.1

### Setting Up Your Environment

To set up your environment, you can choose one of the following methods:

1. **Using `conda`**:
   ```bash
   conda create -n docfusion python=3.11
   conda activate docfusion
   ```

2. **Using `venv`**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv docfusion
   source docfusion/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
   .\docfusion\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
   ```

3. **Using `poetry`**:
   ```bash
   poetry new docfusion
   cd docfusion
   poetry install
   ```

### Installing PyTorch

To install PyTorch, choose one of the following options based on whether you want GPU support:

- **With GPU support (CUDA 12.1)**:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
   ```

- **Without GPU support**:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
   ```

### Installing DocFusion

Once your environment is set up and PyTorch is installed, you can install DocFusion:

1. **From PyPI**:
   ```bash
   pip install docfusion-ai
   ```

2. **From source**:
   If you prefer to install directly from the source, you can use the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Here's a quick example to demonstrate the power of **DocFusion**:

```python
from docfusion import DocFusion

# Initialize DocFusion
docfusion = DocFusion()

# Load a document
doc = docfusion.load_document("sample.pdf")
# Load a images
# doc = docfusion.load_image("sample.png")

# Detect layout
layout = docfusion.detect_layout(doc)

# Perform OCR
text = docfusion.extract_text(doc)

# Extract tables
tables = docfusion.extract_tables(doc)

# Print results
print("Layout:", layout)
print("Text:", text)
print("Tables:", tables)

```

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

**DocFusion** organizes document processing tasks into modular components. Each component corresponds to a specific task and offers:

1. **A Unified Interface:** Consistent input and output formats.
2. **Model Independence:** Switch between libraries or models effortlessly.
3. **Pipeline Flexibility:** Combine components to create custom workflows.

## üìà Roadmap

- Add support for semantic understanding tasks (e.g., entity extraction).
- Integrate pre-trained transformer models for context-aware document analysis.
- Expand pipelines for multilingual document processing.
- Add CLI support for batch processing.
